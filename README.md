# Qt cURL

Qt cURL is file system based API client. The data stored in the form of curl command, so we can share those with anyone even if they don't have the app.

As it's file system based, we can use git to manager/backup/collaboration.

# Why?

- Don't like ElectronJS apps, (or any JS based app).
- Don't want another cloud based app.
- Don't want another file type to store request, prefer something reusable format.

## Generating Parser 

To generate parser, execute the command:

`java -jar antlr-4.13.1-complete.jar -Dlanguage=Python3 -o parser Curl.g4`

## Parsing

- Cannot parse any curl query, but only which is generated by the app.
